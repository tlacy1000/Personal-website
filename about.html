    <h3> So, how did I get here? </h3>
    <br>
    <p> When I was 18 years old,I had a strong interest in science. There were so many things I was interested in-
      biology, psychology, physiology, chemistry.</p>
    <p>I had no idea what exactly I wanted to do, until I found the perfect solution- something that incorporated all of
      these! The wonderful, multidisciplinary world of: Neuroscience!</p>

        What do you get when you put biology, psychology and chemistry together? Neuro!

    <p>I did my undergrad in behavioral neuroscience- a specialty of neuro that focuses on the application of the
      principles of biology to the study of physiological, genetic, and developmental mechanisms of behavior in humans
      and other animals.</p>
    <p>Throughout the years I worked in home health nursing, long term care facilities, hospitals, and various research
      labs. I had the time of my life learning all about the brain and what makes it tick- pretty cool to use an organ
      to study itself!</p>



    <p> After graduation, I sought to refine my interests. I knew I had a strong interest in the applications of
      learning, data science, and software development.</p>
    <p>When I learned about UT's Austin software engineering and web development program, I knew I'd found my calling.

    <p>These days, I'm currently enrolled in the program and refining my skills so that I can be a software developer in
      the future.
      <p> I'm most interested in combining my skills as a scientist with my newfound passion for being a developer- I'd
        love to work with machine learning models, neural networks and big data.</p>
      <p> I've got great insight into how the brain works and organic neural networks, and I'd love to apply that
        knowledge to software that learns as we do.</p>
